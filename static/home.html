    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Aditya Rudola</strong>, a passionate Cloud and DevOps enthusiast currently pursuing my MCA at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology. With a strong foundation in computer applications from my BCA at IITM Janakpuri, I have hands-on experience in building cloud-native solutions using AWS services like EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, and S3. I’ve interned as a Cloud Engineer at Seldom Labs, where I automated infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. Earlier, as a Software Development Intern at Entab Infotech, I worked on modules like student registration and fee management using ASP.NET, C#, and MS-SQL. I’ve also developed and deployed several projects including <em>Expora</em>, a virtual travel companion offering immersive 360° tours, and a production-grade DevOps pipeline for a Golang web application. I enjoy blending development with cloud technologies and aim to simplify DevOps for learners by sharing practical, beginner-friendly resources.
